Hi! I’m Mukundh, an incoming PhD student in the Genetics program at Stanford University. I’m fascinated by how the trillions of cells that make up our bodies keep us alive and thriving—while also defending us from pathogens and microbes—through a web of emergent and intricate molecular, cellular, and organ-level systems. Whether it’s genome regulation through the interplay of regulatory elements, chromatin accessibility, and methylation; tissue development through cell-cell signaling and mechanical interactions; or even consciousness arising from networks of neurons that let us think, feel, and act—I’m captivated by how these layers of biology come together.

During high school and college, I interned at startups like [Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/), [Asimov](https://www.asimov.com/), and [Octant Biosciences](https://www.octant.bio/). What drew me to these companies was their focus on biological emergence—going beyond the classic single target rational drug design model of discovery.

After that, I spent two years at the Broad Institute in the Macosko lab analyzing sequencing data from 1.3 million white blood cells as part of a longitudinal cohort study in New Zealand. I uncovered transcriptomic associations with a range of clinical traits, applying—and contributing to the development of—a new statistical method to do so. While the data was limited to associations and a single modality, the project sparked my deeper interest in statistical genetics, sequencing assays, and immunology. It was also during that time—thanks to attending a huge variety of seminars—that I internalized that biology's only rule is that there’s an exception to every rule.

During my PhD, I hope to explore rules (or exceptions thereof) that explain how genetic mutations ripple through biological layers to result in disease(s). Right now, I’m most drawn to the immune system, and I hope to gain experience in both computational work—using observational data to identify genomic features linked to emergent phenotypes—and experimental work to functionally perturb these key features.

Outside of science, I love traveling (I’ve been to 15 countries [link to map/list here]), reading biographies (especially of physician-scientists), biking, folding origami, and hiking/backpacking.

I love learning—whether it’s about science or different human perspectives, philosophies, and stories—and always enjoy a deep conversation – you can reach me at mukundh[dot]murthy[at]icloud[dot]com
