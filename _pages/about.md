Hi! I’m Mukundh, an incoming PhD student in the Genetics program at Stanford University. I’m fascinated by biological emergence—how trillions of individual cells give rise to the complex, self-regulating systems that keep us alive and thriving. From genome regulation shaped by chromatin accessibility and regulatory elements, to tissue development orchestrated by cell-cell signaling, to consciousness—I’m captivated by how coordinated behaviors emerge from molecular parts.

During high school and college, I interned at startups like [Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/), [Asimov](https://www.asimov.com/), and [Octant Biosciences](https://www.octant.bio/). What drew me to these companies was their focus on biological emergence—going beyond the classic single target rational drug design model of discovery.

I then spent two years at the Broad Institute in the [Macosko Lab](https://macoskolab.com/), analyzing sequencing data from 1.3 million white blood cells collected as part of a longitudinal cohort study in New Zealand. I identified transcriptomic associations with clinical traits and contributed to [a new statistical method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02169-3) to support this work. This experience deepened my interest in statistical genetics, sequencing technologies, and immunology.

During my PhD, I hope to uncover how genetic variation cascades through layers of emergence to influence disease—especially within the immune system. I’m excited to explore both computational approaches for identifying genomic drivers of emergent phenotypes, and experimental tools to functionally probe them.

Outside of science, I love traveling, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/132281867-mukundh-murthy?shelf=currently-reading) biographies (especially of physician-scientists), biking, folding origami, and hiking/backpacking.

I love learning—whether it’s about science or different perspectives, philosophies, and stories — and always enjoy a deep conversation – you can reach me at mukundh[dot]murthy[at]icloud[dot]com.
